# RealmSwiftFHIR
RealmSwiftFHIR is an adaptation of [smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR/) which supports [Realm](https://realm.io) for data persistence. Checkout [the original Swift-FHIR project](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR/) for  details on the SwiftFHIR itself.

## Primary Keys
All FHIR `Resources` and `Elements` can be persisted to a Realm database via normal Realm means (`realm.add`, `realm.delete`, etc). Resource and Element `pk` properties are the primary keys, and default to a UUID string if instantiated normally (eg. `let p = Patient()`). ~~The exception is when inflating from JSON. In this scenario the `pk` will default to the value contained in the `id` field, if one exists; otherwise it will revert to its default~~ (no longer the case as of v0.2.1).

## Generated by [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2)'s Giant Brain
The classes were generated by a forked verision of [smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser), which can be found at [ryanbaldwin/fhir-parser](https://github.com/ryanbaldwin/fhir-parser). This project will soon be closing and moved into this project proper, as Pascal has removed language packs from the `fhir-parser` project (can't say I blame him...). 

Give credit where credit is due, this wouldn't exist without [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2), so buy him a giant cake with a pinup girl inside.

### State of the Union
RealmSwiftFHIR is brand new and should be considered a Work In Progress. While initial testing appears to be working, and all unit tests pass, I've yet to actually use it in anything substantial. Use this at your own risk, and let me know if there are any gotchas. I'll build an enhancement/bug list as time goes by.

### Versioning
Current of `RealmSmartFHIR` is `v0.2.1` and is based on the [FHIR DSTU2 spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/).

### Using RealmSwiftFHIR
This project currently supports Carthage, and I'll likely never support Cocoa-Pods because Cocoa-Pods, well, honestly, I hate Cocoa-Pods, it makes me cry and it doesn't care. It doesn't write home or check up on me or see how I'm doing. It just moves in and destroys my life. 

0. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), if you haven't already.
1. Add `github "ryanbaldwin/RealmSwiftFHIR" == 0.2.1` to your `Cartfile`
2. Do a quick `carthage update` and add the [framework to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) as you normally would.
3. Build a kick ass application
4. Buy [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2) a beer, because none of this is possible without his amazing work
