# FireKit
FireKit is an adaptation of [smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR/), with one notable difference: All FHIR Resources and Elements are [Realm](https://realm.io) ready out of the box. No more annoying, horrible, terrible, mapping code between JSON, FHIR, some backing datamodel.

## Examples

```Swift
import FireKit


// You can hydrate a patient with some JSON from your FHIR Server and 
// natively save it to a Realm
let realm = try! Realm()
let patientResponseJSONData = someMagicalFHIREndpoint(patientId: 123)
let patient = try! JSONDecoder().decode(Patient.self, from: patientResponseJSONData)
try! realm.write { realm.add(patient) }
 
// Alternatively you can Create your own patient
let sickman = Patient()
sickman.gender = "M"
sickman.name.append(HumanName())
sickman.name[0].given.append(RealmString(val: "Joey"))
sickman.name[0].family.append(RealmString(val: "Baloney"))
try! realm.write { realm.add(sickman) }

// You can update properties on your realm object as you normally would
 try! realm.write {
    sickman.name[0].given[0].value = "Joseph"
    sickman.name[0].family[0].value = "Balogna"
 }

// And of course, you can query for your Patient
let joeys = realm.objects(Patient.self).filter {
    $0.name.filter {
        $0.given.filter {
            $0.value == "Joseph"
        }.count > 0
    }.count > 0
}

// You can also fetch a patient by its ID (not guaranteed to be unique in FireKit)
let lonelyJoey = realm.objects(Patient.self).filter("id == %@", "123").first // returns Patient?

// Or you can fetch a patient by it's FireKit local primary key
let THEJoey = realm.object(ofType: Patient.self, forPrimaryKey: lonelyJoey?.pk)

// You can create an unmanaged duplicate by simply calling `copy`
// This is convenient if you have a ViewController which operates over
// a lot of the fields of a FHIR resource, and you don't want to continuously 
// modify each field in the managed resource in a write transaction.
let twinJoey = lonelyJoey?.copy() as! Patient
twinJoey.name[0].given[0].value = "Joe"
twinJoey.name[0].family[0].value = "MysteryMeat"

// You can populate an existing instance with data from another instance
// This will overwrite all data in the target instance. 
// You would do this to get the changes from your unamanged (e.g. _twinJoey_ above)
// back into the managed instance.
try! realm.write { lonelyJoey?.populate(from: twinJoey) }
```

# Installation
You have 2 options: 

1. [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) (which will download the binaries attached to the appropriate Release)
2. Good ol' fashioned Clone 'n Build.

## Carthage
1. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), if you haven't already.
2. Add `github "ryanbaldwin/FireKit" == 2.401.05` to the your `Cartfile` (see [Versioning](#versioning) for more info)
3. Do a quick `carthage update --platform iOS --cache-builds` and add the [framework to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) as you normally would.
4. Build a kick ass health app and never worry about your datamodel again.

A generous pull request donated by @stupergenius has fixed the Carthage issues when using `--no-use-binaries`, or if your local Swift compiler version doesn't match that which was used to compile the binaries. As of FireKit `v2.401.05`, Carthage will now properly `pull` the branch and build it and its dependencies. So if you use FireKit, and you've been annoyed by my lack of mad Carthage skillz, then buy @stupergenius a beer or send him $5 or something, he's a good guy that guy.

## Clone 'n Build
1. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repo.
3. `cd` into the `firekit` project directory where the various `Cartfile`s reside.
4. run `./xcarthage bootstrap` to download the dependencies, both binary and external projects such as [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2)'s `fhir-parser` (which does the actual parsing)
5. run `./generate`
6. Open the `firekit.xcworkspace`
7. Build and run the tests as you would for any other Xcode project.
        
# Modifying FireKit
All classes and tests in FireKit are generated using [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2)'s [smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser) and some old Swift3 templates he once had which I modified. Therefore, if you're interested in modifying the classes/tests, then it's best to modify the templates and re-generate the `*.swift` files using the `./generate` tool in step `5` above.

The templates can be found in the `fhir-parser-resources/FHIR-1.6.0` directory. The main file's you'll be looking at modifying are:
 - `template-resource.swift`
 - `template-unittest.swift`

After making the changes you want (or didn't mean to make), you can re-generate _all_ the files by simply running the `./generate` script. This is an all or nothing Royal Rumble of code generation, and absolutely all `.swift` files will be overwritten. It is unapologetic in its aggressiveness. It cares not about your feelings. It is death, and it comes for your files.

# Versioning
Welcome to Crazytown! There are a lot of moving parts when it comes to versioning. The version number is composed by the following:

- "Major" Version is the FHIR STU Version (currently `2` for `DSTU2`)
- "Minor" version number is actually the Swift Version (`31` for `Swift 3.1`)
- The build number is the typical build number, the _actual_ build number.

The current version of `FireKit` is `v2.401.05` and is based on the [FHIR DSTU2 spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/).

## Version Matrix
| Swift Version | DSTU2        | STU3  |
| :---          | :---:        | :---: |
| 4.0           | `v2.401.05`  | n/a   |
| 3.1           | `v2.31.03`   | n/a   |
| 3.0.2         | `v0.2.3`     | n/a   |

*Update*: I'm way behind on creating a version for STU3. I'm trying to get a lot of kinks out before splitting versions. Sorry. ðŸ˜”

# What's Distinct to FireKit
While most of FireKit follows as closely as possible to [smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR)'s original implementation, certain provisions had to be made in order to accomodate Realm.

## RealmSwift.Object
Everything ultimately inherits from a `RealmSwift.Object`. This is the secret sauce for persistence. This includes all Resources and Elements.

## Primary Keys
All FHIR Resource and Element types have a `pk` field on them, which defaults to a `UUID().uuidString` value. These `pk` fields are designated as the PrimaryKeys for Realm. You can change this value so long as the object upon which you're acting has not already been saved (i.e. the object is _unmanaged_, in the parlance of Realm).

## JSON Serialization
All `FireKit` types fully conform to Swift 4's `Codable` protocol. As such, you can serialize and deserialize using Swift 4's `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`. Example:

```Swift
let patient = Patient()
let name = HumanName()
name.family.append(RealmString(val: "Baldwin"))
name.given.append(RealmString(val: "Ryan"))
patient.name.append(name)

let jsonData = try? JSONEncoder().encode(patient)

let inflatedPatient = try? JSONDeocder().decode(Patient.self, from: jsonData!)
```

Two worthy notes about JSON Serialization:

1. The `pk` field is _never_ serialized. It stays local. As the old adage goes, _What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas_.
2. When populating a managed instance via `instance.populate<T: Resource>(from: T)`, any element list types (such as `Patient.name`) will be overwritten with the `from` instance. This includes _removing_ items that are in `instance`, but not in `from`. Order of items in `from` will be maintained.

Moral of the story: Do not let multiple Resources point to the same managed Element instance (e.g. 2 `Patient` managed instances each pointing to the same `HumanName` realm instance). In the words of [Egon Spengler](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72FiKtrMAjIb0Rhu/giphy.gif): 

> _"Don't cross the streams. It would be bad."_

## Upsert a Property
This whole "Don't share the element primary keys" business can be a total pain in the ass. If you're unsure about where your element is coming from (i.e. if it's new, persisted, etc), you can assign the Element value to a Resource's property using its associated `upsert` function. 

Each non-list Element property on a Resource has an `upsert` function, with a parameter label of the same name as the property. For example, the `Patient` class has the following:

```Swift
public dynamic var animal: PatientAnimal?        
public func upsert(animal: PatientAnimal?)

public dynamic var managingOrganization: Reference?
public func upsert(managingOrganization: Reference?)
```

These `upsert` functions will manage the primary key for you. So don't sweat it, just upsert it!

## Realm Extensions
`FireKit` also comes with a few handy extensions on the Realm class.

### Get a Resource by its ID
A common scenario is fetching 1 or many Resources by `id`. `FireKit` provides 2 functions for that:
```Swift 
extension Realm {
    public func resource<T: Resource>(_ ofType: T.Type, withId id: String) -> T?
    public func resources<T: Resource>(_ ofType: T.Type, withIds ids: [String]) -> Results<T>
}

let realm = Realm()
let patient = realm.resource(Patient.self, withId: "123")
let patients = realm.resources(Patient.self, withIds: ["123", "456", "ABC"])
```

### Upsert an Entire Resource
As of `v2.40.02`, you can now `upsert` an entire Resource (or array of Resources) using 2 Realm extensions:
```Swift
@discardableResult public func upsert<R>(_ resource: R) -> R where R: Resource
@discardableResult public func upsert<R>(_ resources: [R]) -> [R] where R: Resource
```

These come in handy if you're grabbing a remote Resource and you want to throw it in Realm without checking whether it exists.
```Swift
let realm = Realm()
let incomingPatient = getSomeRemotePatientFromServer()
try realm.write {
    realm.upsert(incomingPatient)
}
```

If a local `Patient` with the same `id` as the `incomingPatient` already exists, `realm.upsert` will update the local `Patient` to match `incomingPatient`. Otherwise, `realm.upsert` will add the `incomingPatient`, while preserving all `pk` fields. These are basically convenience functions over having to do the following:
```Swift
let realm = Realm()
let incomingPatient = getSomeRemotePatientFromServer()
guard let existingPatient = realm.resource(Patient.self, withId: incomingPatient.id!) else {
    try realm.write { realm.add(incomingPatient) }
    return
}

try realm.write {
    existingPatient.populate(from: incomingPatient)
}
```

## RealmList vs. Arrays
All Swift-FHIR array properties (such as `Patient.name: [HumanName]`) have been replaced with `RealmList<>` properties (such as `Patient.name = RealmList<HumanName>()`). This facilitates the one-to-many relationships in Realm.

Furthermore, Realm does not support RealmList's of primitives. As a result, what would normally be `[String]` in Swift-FHIR, is now `RealmList<RealmString>`; `[Int]` is now `RealmList<RealmInt>`, and so on. Each `Realm*` type has a single property, `value`, which contains the actual value. 

## RealmOptional vs. Optional Primitives
Realm straight up doesn't support optionals beyond `String?`, `Date?`, and `Data?`. As a result, What would normally be `Bool?` in Realm-FHIR, is a wrapped `RealmOptional<Bool>` in FireKit; `Int?` is now `RealmOptional<Int>`, and so on. 

Each [`RealmOptional<T>`](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/api/Classes/RealmOptional.html) has a `value: T?` within.

# State of the Union
FireKit should be considered a Work In Progress. I've only just started using it in a real world project, and am dogfooding and actively fixing bugs, making improvements, etc. as required. Use this at your own risk, but it should be fine, but use it at your own risk.

If you find any bugs or have any enhancements, ideas, questions, etc. Create an issue. Or, better yet, create a pull request and give it some love.
